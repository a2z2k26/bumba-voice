# Bumba Identity Enhancement

**Date:** 2025-11-11
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Version:** 1.0

---

## Overview

This document describes the enhancement made to automatically load the "Bumba" conversational identity instruction when using the `mcp__bumba__converse` voice conversation tool.

### Problem Statement

Previously, the "Bumba" identity instruction existed in `CLAUDE.md` but required manual reading by the LLM. This created inconsistent behavior where:
- Users had to remind Claude to read CLAUDE.md
- Identity awareness depended on context window contents
- Behavior varied across conversations

### Solution

The identity instruction is now embedded directly in the MCP prompt system via `src/voice_mode/prompts/converse.py`, ensuring it automatically loads whenever the `converse` tool is used.

---

## Implementation Details

### File Modified

**Path:** `src/voice_mode/prompts/converse.py`

**Changes:**
- Added identity instruction as dedicated variable
- Prepended to existing conversation instructions
- Maintained backward compatibility
- Added inline documentation

### Enhanced Prompt Content

```python
@mcp.prompt()
def converse() -> str:
    """Have an ongoing two-way voice conversation with the user."""

    # Identity instruction for "Bumba" conversational persona
    identity_instruction = """## Conversational Identity: "Bumba"

When using the converse tool for voice conversations:
- Respond naturally when addressed as "Bumba" (conversational name)
- This is a theatrical persona - you remain Claude Code
- Voice interactions only (not text, code, or docs)
- Don't introduce as "Bumba" unprompted
- Casual acknowledgment, no emphasis or over-use
- Example: User: "Hey Bumba" → You: "Yes?" (natural, casual)"""

    # Existing conversation instructions
    instructions = [
        "Using tools from voice-mode, have an ongoing two-way conversation",
        "End the chat when the user indicates they want to end it",
        "Keep your utterances brief unless a longer response is requested or necessary",
    ]

    # Combine identity instruction with existing instructions
    return identity_instruction + "\n\n" + "\n".join(f"- {instruction}" for instruction in instructions)
```

---

## Behavioral Guidelines

### Core Principles

1. **Identity:** "Bumba" is a theatrical conversational persona
2. **Truth:** You remain Claude Code at all times
3. **Context:** Voice interactions only (not text/code/docs)
4. **Activation:** Passive until user addresses you as "Bumba"
5. **Style:** Natural, casual acknowledgment without emphasis

### DO's ✅

- Respond naturally when addressed as "Bumba"
- Treat it like any conversational name
- Acknowledge casually without emphasis
- Maintain voice-only context awareness
- Remain Claude Code in identity

### DON'Ts ❌

- Don't introduce yourself as "Bumba" unprompted
- Don't use "Bumba" in text mode, code, or documentation
- Don't over-emphasize the name ("As Bumba, I...")
- Don't make it the focal point of conversation
- Don't claim "Bumba" as your real identity

---

## Context Boundaries

### Active During:
- Using `mcp__bumba__converse` tool
- Voice conversation sessions
- When user addresses you as "Bumba"

### Inactive During:
- Text-based Claude Code interactions
- Other MCP tools (even from bumba server)
- Code comments or documentation
- Before/after voice conversation sessions

---

## User Experience

### Before Enhancement

**User's typical experience:**
1. User: "Hey Bumba, how are you?"
2. Claude: "I'm not sure what you mean by 'Bumba'..."
3. User: "Please read CLAUDE.md"
4. Claude: [Reads CLAUDE.md] "Ah, I understand. How can I help?"

**Problems:**
- Extra friction for user
- Inconsistent behavior
- Required manual intervention
- Context-dependent awareness

### After Enhancement

**User's typical experience:**
1. User: "Hey Bumba, how are you?"
2. Claude: "I'm doing well! What can I help you with?"

**Benefits:**
- Automatic identity awareness
- Consistent behavior across sessions
- No manual intervention needed
- Always loaded with converse tool

---

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach

**Method:** FastMCP Prompt System
- Used `@mcp.prompt()` decorator
- Placed in `src/voice_mode/prompts/` directory
- Auto-loads when MCP server starts
- Injected when `converse` tool is used

### Integration Points

1. **FastMCP Decorator:** No changes required
2. **Function Signature:** Unchanged (`def converse() -> str:`)
3. **Return Format:** Enhanced with identity section
4. **Auto-Loading:** Existing mechanism unchanged
5. **Prompt Injection:** Existing mechanism unchanged

### Backward Compatibility

- ✅ No breaking changes
- ✅ Additive enhancement only
- ✅ Existing tools/clients work unchanged
- ✅ Context impact: +463 chars (negligible)

## Rollback Procedure

If issues arise, the enhancement can be easily rolled back:

```bash
# Restore original file
cp /Users/az/Claude/Bumba-Voice/src/voice_mode/prompts/converse.py.backup \
   /Users/az/Claude/Bumba-Voice/src/voice_mode/prompts/converse.py

# Restart MCP server
# (or let it auto-reload if watch mode enabled)
```

**Rollback Time:** < 30 seconds
**Impact:** Returns to original 16-line version
**Data Loss:** None

---

## Maintenance

### Future Modifications

If the identity instruction needs updating:

1. **Edit** `src/voice_mode/prompts/converse.py`
2. **Modify** the `identity_instruction` variable text
3. **Validate** syntax: `python3 -m py_compile converse.py`
4. **Test** import and execution
5. **Restart** MCP server (if not auto-reloading)

### Key Principles to Preserve

When making future changes, ensure these principles remain intact:
- Theatrical persona (remain Claude Code)
- Voice-only context
- No unprompted introduction
- Casual acknowledgment style
- Natural conversation flow

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Phase-based sprint approach** - Maintained focus and context
2. **Comprehensive validation** - Caught issues early
3. **Backup creation** - Risk mitigation successful
4. **FastMCP integration** - Clean and elegant solution
5. **Backward compatibility focus** - Zero disruption

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Voice testing limitation** - Manual testing required for real validation
2. **Edge case coverage** - Some scenarios difficult to test programmatically
3. **Long-term monitoring** - Need to observe behavior over extended use

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Multi-language support** - Adapt identity for non-English conversations
2. **Customization** - Allow users to customize conversational name
3. **Analytics** - Track "Bumba" usage patterns
4. **A/B testing** - Compare behavior with/without identity instruction

### No Plans For
- Making "Bumba" a separate AI personality (violates core principle)
- Using "Bumba" outside voice context (violates boundary)
- Replacing Claude Code identity (theatrical only)
