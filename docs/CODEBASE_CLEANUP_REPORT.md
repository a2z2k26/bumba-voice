5. **Miscellaneous** (Various small files)

---

## 1. Sprint Documentation (High Priority for Removal)

**Location:** `docs/ptt/`
**Total Size:** ~200KB
**Impact:** None (historical only)

### Files Safe to Remove:

```
docs/ptt/SPRINT_4.2_SUMMARY.md          (10.5KB) - Sprint 4.2 completion log
docs/ptt/SPRINT_4.6_TRANSPORT_TESTING.md (11.1KB) - Sprint 4.6 testing log
docs/ptt/SPRINT_5.1_SUMMARY.md           (14KB)  - Sprint 5.1 completion log
docs/ptt/SPRINT_5.2_SUMMARY.md           (15KB)  - Sprint 5.2 completion log
docs/ptt/SPRINT_5.3_SUMMARY.md           (8KB)   - Sprint 5.3 completion log

docs/ptt/SPRINT_5.6_SUMMARY.md           (10.4KB)- Sprint 5.6 completion log
docs/ptt/SPRINT_5.7_SUMMARY.md           (10.7KB)- Sprint 5.7 completion log
docs/ptt/SPRINT_5.8_SUMMARY.md           (9.4KB) - Sprint 5.8 completion log
docs/ptt/PHASE_4_COMPLETION_REPORT.md    (25KB)  - Phase 4 completion (superseded by case study)
docs/ptt/PHASE_5_COMPLETION_REPORT.md    (14.7KB)- Phase 5 completion (superseded by case study)
docs/ptt/PHASE_5_TEST_REPORT.md          (12.5KB)- Phase 5 testing (superseded by case study)
docs/ptt/PHASE_5_PLAN.md                 (18.8KB)- Phase 5 planning (completed)
docs/ptt/PTT_CALLBACK_BUG_FIX.md         (7.2KB) - Bug fix log (resolved, not needed)
```

**Rationale:**
- These are **historical development logs** tracking sprint progress
- All information consolidated in `CASE_STUDY.md` and `ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAMS.md`
- No runtime dependencies
- Valuable for project history but not operational
- Can be archived to a separate `docs/archive/` directory if desired

**Recommendation:**
- **REMOVE** all sprint summaries and completion reports
- **KEEP**:
  - `README.md` (current PTT documentation)
  - `API_REFERENCE.md` (developer reference)
  - `MODE_COMPARISON.md` (user guide)
  - `HYBRID_VOICE_TEXT_PATTERN.md` (operational pattern)
  - `LIVEKIT_PTT_DECISION.md` (architecture decision record)
  - `MANUAL_TEST_PLAN.md` (ongoing testing reference)
  - `TRANSPORT_INTEGRATION_ANALYSIS.md` (technical reference)

---

## 2. Sprint Tracking (High Priority for Removal)

**Location:** `docs/sprints/`
**Total Size:** ~104KB
**Impact:** None

### Files Safe to Remove:

```
docs/sprints/SPRINT_LOG.md              - Historical sprint log
docs/sprints/SPRINT_TRACKER.md          - Sprint tracking (completed)
```

**Rationale:**
- Project development completed (Phase 5 done)
- All sprint information consolidated in case study
- No operational value

**Recommendation:** **REMOVE** entire `docs/sprints/` directory

---

## 3. Final Reports (Medium Priority for Removal)

**Location:** `docs/reports/`
**Total Size:** ~32KB
**Impact:** None

### Files Safe to Remove:

```

docs/reports/BUMBA_VOICE_FINAL_AUDIT_REPORT.md    - Final audit report
docs/reports/FINAL_ACHIEVEMENT_REPORT.md     - Final achievements
docs/reports/OPTIMIZATION_FIXES.md           - Optimization log
```

**Rationale:**
- All achievements documented in `CASE_STUDY.md`
- Historical completion markers
- No runtime dependencies

**Recommendation:** **REMOVE** entire `docs/reports/` directory

---

## 4. Historical Conversations (Medium Priority for Removal)

**Location:** `docs/conversations/`
**Total Size:** ~124KB
**Impact:** None

### Files Safe to Remove:

```
docs/conversations/2025-07-03-claude-gemini-cli-discussion/

docs/conversations/prompts/voice-conversation-prompt-v3.md  (superseded)
docs/conversations/prompts/voice-conversation-prompt.md     (superseded)
```

**Rationale:**
- Historical AI conversation experiments
- Development artifacts not used in production
- Voice prompts superseded by current implementation in `src/voice_mode/prompts/`

**Recommendation:**
- **REMOVE** all dated conversation directories
- **KEEP**: `docs/conversations/prompts/README.md` if it documents current prompt patterns
- **REMOVE** old prompt versions (v1, v2, v3)

---

## 5. Pre-Implementation Research (Low Priority for Removal)

**Location:** `docs/research/`
**Total Size:** ~96KB
**Impact:** None (research phase complete)

### Files Safe to Remove:

```
docs/research/keyboard_library_evaluation.md    - Library evaluation (decision made)
docs/research/platform_permissions.md           - Permission research (implemented)
docs/research/ptt_architecture_core.md          - Initial architecture (superseded)

```

**Rationale:**
- Pre-implementation research and planning
- All decisions implemented and documented in current codebase
- Historical value but no operational use

**Recommendation:**
- **REMOVE** if confident all research findings integrated
- **ARCHIVE** to `docs/archive/research/` if want to preserve history

---

## 6. Duplicate/Obsolete Tests (High Priority for Review)

**Location:** `tests/`
**Estimated Removable:** 10-15 test files

### Candidates for Removal (Require Manual Review):

#### A. Potentially Redundant Integration Tests:

```
tests/integration/test_mcp_audio_final.py         - May supersede test_mcp_audio.py
tests/integration/test_mcp_audio.py               - Check if superseded by _final version
tests/integration/test_mcp_optimization.py        - Check if test_mcp_optimization_quick.py covers this
tests/integration/test_mcp_optimization_quick.py  - Redundant with full version?
tests/integration/test_mcp_server_complete.py     - May supersede earlier test_mcp_integration.py
```

**Action Required:**
- Run each test to verify coverage
- Compare test assertions
- Remove if one fully supersedes the other

#### B. Simple/Stub Tests That May Be Obsolete:

```
tests/unit/test_audio_simple.py                   - Check if superseded by test_audio_implementation.py
tests/unit/test_session_simple.py                 - Check if superseded by test_session_state.py
tests/unit/test_vad_simple.py                     - May be development stub
```

**Action Required:**
- Check git history to see if these were temporary/development tests
- Verify full test suites cover their functionality

#### C. Potentially Obsolete Feature Tests:

```
tests/test_provider_resilience_simple.py          - Superseded by test_provider_resilience.py?
tests/unit/test_noise_suppression.py              - Feature not in final system?
tests/unit/test_echo_cancellation.py              - Feature not in final system?
tests/unit/test_adaptive_silence.py               - Feature not in final system?
```

**Action Required:**
- Verify which features are actually implemented
- Remove tests for unimplemented/removed features

#### D. Manual Test Scripts:

```
tests/manual/                                      - Check what's here
tests/test_ffmpeg_demo.py                         - Demo script, not automated test
tests/test_conversation_browser_playback.py       - Manual playback test
```

**Action Required:**
- Manual test scripts can stay if useful for development
- Remove if obsolete or superseded by automated tests

## 7. Miscellaneous Documentation (Low Priority)

### Files to Consider:

```
docs/guides/IMPROVEMENT_SPRINT_PLAN.md           - Completed plan
docs/guides/REORGANIZATION_PLAN.md               - Completed reorganization
docs/guides/SYSTEM_AUDIT_PLAN.md                 - Completed audit
docs/guides/PROJECT_PLAN.md                      - Superseded by case study?
docs/guides/PRD.md                                - Original PRD (completed)
```

**Recommendation:**
- **REMOVE** completed planning documents
- **KEEP** operational guides like `DOCKER_SETUP.md`, `voicemode-local-setup-guide.md`

---

## 8. Analysis Documents (Low Priority)

### Files to Consider:

```
docs/analysis/LATENCY_OPTIMIZATION_ANALYSIS.md   - Check if findings implemented
docs/analysis/LOW_RISK_LATENCY_IMPROVEMENTS.md   - Check if implemented
```

**Recommendation:**
- **REMOVE** if all findings implemented
- **KEEP** if contains ongoing optimization opportunities

---

## Safe Removal Strategy

### Phase 1: Immediate (Zero Risk)

Remove sprint documentation and completed reports:

```bash
# Backup first!
mkdir -p docs/archive/sprints
mkdir -p docs/archive/reports

# Move sprint docs to archive
mv docs/ptt/SPRINT_*.md docs/archive/sprints/
mv docs/ptt/PHASE_*_COMPLETION_REPORT.md docs/archive/sprints/
mv docs/ptt/PHASE_*_TEST_REPORT.md docs/archive/sprints/
mv docs/ptt/PHASE_*_PLAN.md docs/archive/sprints/
mv docs/ptt/PTT_CALLBACK_BUG_FIX.md docs/archive/sprints/

# Move sprint tracking
mv docs/sprints/* docs/archive/sprints/
rmdir docs/sprints/

# Move reports
mv docs/reports/* docs/archive/reports/
rmdir docs/reports/
```

**Impact:** None - purely historical documentation

### Phase 2: Low Risk

Remove historical conversations and research:

```bash
mkdir -p docs/archive/conversations
mkdir -p docs/archive/research

# Move conversations
mv docs/conversations/2025-* docs/archive/conversations/
mv docs/conversations/prompts/voice-conversation-prompt*.md docs/archive/conversations/

# Move research (after verifying findings integrated)
mv docs/research/* docs/archive/research/
```

**Impact:** Minimal - no operational dependencies

### Phase 3: Manual Review Required

Review and remove redundant tests:

```bash
# Run full test suite first
pytest tests/ -v

# For each candidate test file:
# 1. Check git log to understand purpose
# 2. Verify coverage by other tests
# 3. Remove if truly redundant

# Example (after verification):
# rm tests/integration/test_mcp_audio.py  # if superseded by _final
# rm tests/unit/test_audio_simple.py     # if stub/development only
```

**Impact:** Requires verification to ensure no coverage gaps

---

## Recommended Cleanup Commands

### Conservative Approach (Safest):

```bash
# Create archive directory
mkdir -p docs/archive/{sprints,reports,conversations,research}

# Archive sprint documentation (Phase 1)
mv docs/ptt/SPRINT_*.md docs/archive/sprints/
mv docs/ptt/PHASE_*_*.md docs/archive/sprints/
mv docs/ptt/PTT_CALLBACK_BUG_FIX.md docs/archive/sprints/

# Archive tracking and reports
mv docs/sprints/* docs/archive/sprints/ 2>/dev/null
mv docs/reports/* docs/archive/reports/ 2>/dev/null

# Clean up empty directories
rmdir docs/sprints 2>/dev/null
rmdir docs/reports 2>/dev/null

echo "✅ Phase 1 cleanup complete - verify system still works"
echo "📦 Archived files in docs/archive/ for reference"
```

### Aggressive Approach (After Verification):

```bash
# After verifying Phase 1 cleanup successful:

# Remove archived docs entirely
rm -rf docs/archive/

# Remove historical conversations
rm -rf docs/conversations/2025-*
rm docs/conversations/prompts/voice-conversation-prompt-v*.md

# Remove pre-implementation research
rm -rf docs/research/

# Remove completed planning docs
rm docs/guides/IMPROVEMENT_SPRINT_PLAN.md
rm docs/guides/REORGANIZATION_PLAN.md
rm docs/guides/SYSTEM_AUDIT_PLAN.md

echo "✅ Aggressive cleanup complete"
```

---

## Post-Cleanup Verification

After any cleanup, verify:

```bash
# 1. Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v

# 2. Build package
make build-package

# 3. Check documentation links
# (manually verify README.md and other docs don't reference removed files)

# 4. Run MCP server
python -m voice_mode.server

# 5. Test basic functionality
# (run a simple converse test)
```
