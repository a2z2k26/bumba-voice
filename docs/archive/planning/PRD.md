# Bumba Voice - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Executive Summary

**Project Name:** Bumba Voice (Conversational Helper with Advanced Text-To-Audio)  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** August 29, 2025  
**Status:** Implementation Ready  
**Base Project:** VoiceMode (https://github.com/mbailey/voicemode)  
**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks

## 1. Product Vision

### 1.1 Vision Statement
Bumba Voice is a rebranded and locally-optimized voice assistant system that adapts VoiceMode to run entirely on local models (Whisper for STT and Kokoro for TTS), providing complete privacy, zero API costs, and OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

### 1.2 Mission
To provide a fully local, privacy-first voice interaction system that maintains OpenAI API compatibility while eliminating cloud dependencies and ongoing costs.

### 1.3 Success Metrics
- **Local Operation:** 100% functionality without internet
- **API Compatibility:** Full OpenAI API parity
- **Performance:** <2s STT latency, <1s TTS latency
- **Cost:** $0 ongoing operational costs

## 2. Product Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Rebrand VoiceMode to Bumba Voice:** Update all branding, documentation, and references
2. **Local Model Integration:** Configure Whisper.cpp and Kokoro for local operation
3. **Documentation Update:** Comprehensive setup guides for local deployment
4. **Configuration Management:** Environment-based configuration for easy deployment

### Secondary Objectives
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing VoiceMode features
- Optimize performance for local hardware
- Create Docker containers for easy deployment
- Provide migration path from cloud to local

## 3. Scope

### In Scope
- Forking and rebranding VoiceMode repository
- Configuring local Whisper.cpp for STT
- Configuring local Kokoro for TTS
- Updating documentation for Bumba Voice
- Creating deployment scripts and Docker images
- Testing OpenAI API compatibility

### Out of Scope
- Building new features beyond VoiceMode
- Creating new AI models
- Developing new UI/frontend
- Cloud service integration
- Mobile app development

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Core Adaptations

#### Feature 1: Local Whisper Integration
- **Description:** Replace OpenAI Whisper API with local Whisper.cpp
- **Priority:** P0 (Critical)
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Whisper.cpp server running on port 2022
  - OpenAI-compatible endpoints at `/v1/audio/transcriptions`
  - Support for multiple model sizes (tiny, base, small, large)
  - Automatic model download and setup

#### Feature 2: Local Kokoro TTS Integration
- **Description:** Replace OpenAI TTS with Kokoro FastAPI
- **Priority:** P0 (Critical)
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Kokoro server running on port 8880
  - OpenAI-compatible endpoints at `/v1/audio/speech`
  - Multiple voice options (af_bella, af_sky, am_adam, etc.)
  - Voice blending capabilities

#### Feature 3: Bumba Voice Branding
- **Description:** Rebrand all VoiceMode references to Bumba Voice
- **Priority:** P0 (Critical)
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Updated package name and metadata
  - New documentation with Bumba Voice branding
  - Configuration files renamed appropriately
  - Repository properly attributed to original

## 5. Technical Requirements

### 5.1 System Requirements
- **Operating Systems:** macOS, Linux, Windows (WSL2)
- **Hardware:** 4+ CPU cores, 8GB+ RAM
- **Storage:** 10GB for models
- **Python:** 3.10+

### 5.2 Dependencies
- Whisper.cpp with server mode
- Kokoro FastAPI wrapper
- PortAudio for audio capture
- FFmpeg for audio processing

## 6. Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Core Adaptation
- Days 1-2: Fork repository, setup environment
- Days 3-4: Integrate local models
- Day 5: Complete rebranding

### Week 2: Polish & Documentation
- Days 6-7: Update documentation
- Days 8-9: Testing and optimization
- Day 10: Docker deployment

### Week 3 (Optional): Enhancement
- Additional features and community preparation

## 7. Testing Requirements

- Verify Whisper.cpp STT functionality
- Verify Kokoro TTS functionality
- Test OpenAI API compatibility
- Performance benchmarking
- Cross-platform testing

## 8. Success Criteria

- Bumba Voice runs fully offline
- All voice features work with local models
- Documentation is clear and complete
- Docker deployment successful
- Zero API costs achieved

## 9. Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Model performance on older hardware | Medium | Provide smaller model options |
| API compatibility issues | Low | VoiceMode already verified compatible |
| User setup complexity | Low | Detailed documentation and scripts |

## 10. Deliverables

1. Bumba Voice repository (forked from VoiceMode)
2. Updated documentation
3. Docker images
4. Installation scripts
5. Configuration templates
6. Testing results
