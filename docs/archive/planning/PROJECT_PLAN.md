- Test machines for each platform
- ~10GB storage for models

### Software:
- Python 3.10+
- C++ compiler (for whisper.cpp)
- Docker Desktop
- Git

### External Dependencies:
- Whisper.cpp repository
- Kokoro-FastAPI repository
- VoiceMode original code

## Milestone Schedule

| Milestone | Date | Criteria |
|-----------|------|----------|
| M1: Setup Complete | Day 2 | Repository forked, environment ready |
| M2: Models Working | Day 4 | Local STT/TTS operational |
| M3: Rebrand Complete | Day 5 | All references updated |
| M4: Docs Complete | Day 7 | Installation guides ready |
| M5: Testing Complete | Day 9 | All platforms verified |
| M6: Docker Ready | Day 10 | Containers published |
| M7: v1.0 Release | Day 15 | Public release (optional) |

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks:

1. **API Incompatibility**
   - Risk: Low (VoiceMode already verified)
   - Mitigation: Maintain fallback to original endpoints

2. **Performance Issues**
   - Risk: Medium
   - Mitigation: Provide multiple model sizes

3. **Platform-Specific Bugs**
   - Risk: Low
   - Mitigation: Thorough testing on each platform

### Timeline Risks:

1. **Whisper.cpp Compilation Issues**
   - Buffer: +2 hours
   - Mitigation: Pre-compiled binaries as backup

2. **Documentation Complexity**
   - Buffer: +4 hours
   - Mitigation: Start with essential docs only

## Quality Checklist

### Before Release:
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Documentation reviewed
- [ ] Docker images working
- [ ] Attribution to VoiceMode included
- [ ] LICENSE file updated
- [ ] No hardcoded paths/credentials

### Performance Targets:
- STT latency: <2 seconds
- TTS latency: <1 second
- Memory usage: <4GB
- CPU usage: <50% average

## Communication Plan

### Daily Updates:
- Brief status in project channel
- Blockers identified immediately

### Weekly Review:
- Progress against milestones
- Risk assessment update
- Timeline adjustments if needed

## Budget

### Time Investment:
- Week 1: 20-25 hours
- Week 2: 15-20 hours
- Week 3: 15 hours (optional)
- **Total: 35-60 hours**

### Costs:
- Development time: Primary cost
- Infrastructure: $0 (all local)
- API costs: $0 (entire point of project)
- Hosting: ~$5/month for Docker Hub (optional)

## Success Metrics

### Technical Success:
- ✅ Runs completely offline
- ✅ OpenAI API compatible
- ✅ <2s STT, <1s TTS latency
- ✅ Works on all major platforms

### Adoption Success:
- 10+ GitHub stars in first week
- 5+ successful deployments reported
- Positive community feedback
- No critical bugs in first month

## Conclusion

This is a straightforward adaptation project that should take 2-3 weeks of part-time work. The main effort is in:
1. Setting up local models (30% effort)
2. Rebranding (20% effort)
3. Documentation (30% effort)
4. Testing (20% effort)

The project leverages existing, working code from VoiceMode, minimizing development risk and ensuring a quick turnaround.
