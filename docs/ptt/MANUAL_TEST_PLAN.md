# PTT Manual Testing Plan

**Sprints:** Phase 4 Sprints 4.5-4.6
**Date:** 2025-11-09
**Purpose:** Manual testing with real hardware (keyboard + microphone)

---

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive manual testing procedures for the PTT feature with actual keyboard and audio hardware. These tests validate the end-to-end integration that automated tests cannot cover.

---

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements

- ✅ macOS 10.14+ / Linux / Windows 10+
- ✅ Physical keyboard
- ✅ Working microphone (built-in or external)
- ✅ Bumba Voice installed and configured
- ✅ Python 3.10+

### Configuration

**Enable PTT:**
```bash
# In ~/.bumba/bumba.env or environment
export BUMBA_PTT_ENABLED=true
export BUMBA_PTT_MODE=hold  # or toggle, or hybrid
export BUMBA_PTT_KEY_COMBO=down+right  # or your preference
export BUMBA_PTT_CANCEL_KEY=esc
export BUMBA_PTT_TIMEOUT=120.0
export BUMBA_PTT_MIN_DURATION=0.5
export BUMBA_SILENCE_THRESHOLD_MS=1500
```

**Verify Installation:**
```bash
# Test PTT imports
python3 -c "from voice_mode.ptt import PTTController; print('PTT OK')"

# Check keyboard permissions (macOS)
python3 -c "from voice_mode.ptt import check_keyboard_permissions; check_keyboard_permissions()"
```

### Keyboard Permissions (macOS Only)

PTT requires accessibility permissions on macOS:

1. Go to System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy → Accessibility
2. Add your terminal application (Terminal.app, iTerm2, etc.)
3. Restart terminal

**Verify:**
```bash
python3 -c "from voice_mode.ptt import check_keyboard_permissions; print(check_keyboard_permissions())"
# Should print: True
```

## Test Suite

### Test 1: Basic PTT Functionality (Hold Mode)

**Objective:** Verify basic press-and-hold recording works

**Setup:**
```bash
export BUMBA_PTT_MODE=hold
export BUMBA_PTT_KEY_COMBO=down+right
```

**Procedure:**
1. Start Bumba Voice CLI: `python -m voice_mode.server`
2. Use the converse tool with `wait_for_response=True`
3. When you see "listening" message:
   - Press and hold DOWN + RIGHT arrow keys
   - Speak: "This is a test recording"
   - Release keys
4. Verify transcription appears

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Recording starts only when keys are pressed
- ✅ Recording continues while keys are held
- ✅ Recording stops immediately when keys released
- ✅ Audio is transcribed correctly
- ✅ No recording happens before key press

**Pass Criteria:**
- Recording triggered by keyboard
- Transcription matches spoken words
- No false triggers

---

### Test 2: Minimum Duration Enforcement (Hold Mode)

**Objective:** Verify minimum recording duration is enforced

**Setup:**
```bash
export BUMBA_PTT_MODE=hold
export BUMBA_PTT_MIN_DURATION=2.0  # 2 seconds minimum
```

**Procedure:**
1. Press and hold keys
2. Speak a word
3. Release keys immediately (< 2 seconds)
4. Observe behavior

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Recording continues for at least 2 seconds even after release
- ✅ Short key presses don't create invalid recordings

**Pass Criteria:**
- Minimum duration enforced

---

### Test 3: Toggle Mode

**Objective:** Verify toggle mode (press to start, press again to stop)

**Setup:**
```bash
export BUMBA_PTT_MODE=toggle
export BUMBA_PTT_KEY_COMBO=down+right
```

**Procedure:**
1. Start converse tool
2. Press DOWN + RIGHT (don't hold)
3. Release keys
4. Speak: "This is toggle mode"
5. Press DOWN + RIGHT again (to stop)
6. Verify transcription

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ First press starts recording
- ✅ Can release keys, recording continues
- ✅ Second press stops recording
- ✅ Transcription appears after second press

**Pass Criteria:**
- Hands-free recording after first press
- Second press successfully stops
- No recording before first press

---

### Test 4: Hybrid Mode (Hold + Silence Detection)

**Objective:** Verify hybrid mode combines hold with automatic silence detection

**Setup:**
```bash
export BUMBA_PTT_MODE=hybrid
export BUMBA_SILENCE_THRESHOLD_MS=1500  # 1.5 seconds of silence
```

**Procedure:**
1. Press and hold keys

- ✅ Recording auto-stops after 1.5s of silence
- ✅ OR recording stops when keys released (whichever comes first)

**Pass Criteria:**
- Silence detection works
- Can still manually stop by releasing keys
- Best of both worlds

---

### Test 5: Cancel Key

**Objective:** Verify cancel key discards recording

**Setup:**
```bash
export BUMBA_PTT_MODE=hold
export BUMBA_PTT_CANCEL_KEY=esc
```

**Procedure:**

- ✅ No crash or error

**Pass Criteria:**
- Timeout enforced
- Graceful handling
- System remains responsive

---

- ✅ Auto transport: Correct behavior based on LiveKit availability

**Pass Criteria:**
- Transport selection works correctly
- PTT only applied to local transport
