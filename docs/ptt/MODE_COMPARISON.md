- Accessibility use cases
- Multi-tasking while speaking
- Presentations or narration

**Configuration:**
```python
from voice_mode import config
config.PTT_MODE = "toggle"
config.PTT_TIMEOUT = 120.0  # 2 minute safety timeout
```

**Example Use Cases:**
- Writing emails via dictation
- Code review commentary
- Podcast recording
- Accessibility-focused applications
- Reading from notes while recording

### Hybrid Mode (Smart PTT)

**How it works:**
1. Press and hold key (like Hold mode)
2. Speak while holding
3. Release OR stay silent for N seconds
4. Auto-stops on silence detection

**Pros:**
- ✅ Manual control like Hold mode
- ✅ Auto-stop on silence (smart)
- ✅ Best of both worlds
- ✅ Natural conversation flow
- ✅ Flexible for variable-length inputs
- ✅ Can release early OR let silence stop it

**Cons:**

- ⚠️ Slightly more complex
- ⚠️ Silence threshold needs tuning

**Best For:**
- Natural conversation with AI
- Variable-length responses
- Users who want smart automation
- Mixed short/long inputs
- Professional voice assistant use

**Configuration:**
```python
from voice_mode import config
config.PTT_MODE = "hybrid"
config.PTT_MIN_DURATION = 0.5
config.SILENCE_THRESHOLD_MS = 1500  # 1.5s silence = auto-stop
```

**Example Use Cases:**
- Conversing with Claude Code
- Q&A sessions
- Voice-driven coding assistance
- Interactive voice applications

## Configuration Recommendations

### Hold Mode - Optimal Settings

```python
from voice_mode import config

config.PTT_MODE = "hold"
config.PTT_MIN_DURATION = 0.5      # Prevent accidental clicks
config.PTT_TIMEOUT = 30.0          # 30s max (safety)
config.PTT_KEY_COMBO = "ctrl+space"  # Easy to hold
```

**Key Combo Recommendations:**
- `space` - Very easy but may conflict
- `ctrl+space` - Good balance
- `alt+space` - Alternative
- `F12` - Dedicated function key
- Avoid: `shift` (used in typing)

---

### Toggle Mode - Optimal Settings

```python
from voice_mode import config

config.PTT_MODE = "toggle"
config.PTT_TIMEOUT = 120.0         # 2 min max (longer for dictation)
config.PTT_KEY_COMBO = "F9"        # Dedicated key
```

**Key Combo Recommendations:**
- `F9` or `F10` - Dedicated, hard to accidentally press
- `ctrl+alt+r` - Deliberate combination
- Avoid: `space`, `enter` (accidental toggling)

---

### Hybrid Mode - Optimal Settings

```python
from voice_mode import config

config.PTT_MODE = "hybrid"
config.PTT_MIN_DURATION = 0.5
config.SILENCE_THRESHOLD_MS = 1500  # Tune based on speech patterns
config.PTT_TIMEOUT = 60.0           # 1 min max
config.PTT_KEY_COMBO = "option_r" # Right Option Key (default)
```

**Silence Threshold Tuning:**
- Fast speakers: 1000ms (1 second)
- Normal pace: 1500ms (1.5 seconds)
- Thoughtful/slow: 2000-3000ms (2-3 seconds)
- Language learning: 3000-5000ms (3-5 seconds)

**Key Combo Recommendations:**
- `option_r` - Right Option Key (default, macOS friendly)
- `ctrl+r` - Memorable
- `F11` - Dedicated key
- Avoid: Single keys (may stop on pause)

## Migration Guide

### Moving from Hold to Hybrid

If you're comfortable with Hold mode but want smarter behavior:

1. Keep the same key combo
2. Set silence threshold conservatively high (3000ms)
3. Gradually decrease threshold as you get used to it
4. You can still release manually like Hold mode

```python
# Before (Hold)
config.PTT_MODE = "hold"
config.PTT_KEY_COMBO = "ctrl+space"

# After (Hybrid) - conservative
config.PTT_MODE = "hybrid"
config.PTT_KEY_COMBO = "ctrl+space"  # Same key
config.SILENCE_THRESHOLD_MS = 3000   # Conservative
```

### Moving from Toggle to Hybrid

If you use Toggle for hands-free but want more control:

1. Switch to Hybrid
2. Use higher silence threshold
3. Benefit: Can release early if needed

```python
# Before (Toggle)
config.PTT_MODE = "toggle"

# After (Hybrid)
config.PTT_MODE = "hybrid"
config.SILENCE_THRESHOLD_MS = 2000  # Let silence end most recordings
# Can still release key manually when needed
```

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Customer Service Call Center

**Need:** Quick, controlled responses to customers

**Recommendation:** **Hold Mode**
- Fast response times
- Precise control
- No accidental long recordings
- Familiar to operators

```python
config.PTT_MODE = "hold"
config.PTT_MIN_DURATION = 0.3
config.PTT_TIMEOUT = 20.0  # Responses should be concise
```

---

### Scenario 2: Legal Dictation

**Need:** Long transcriptions of notes/documents

**Recommendation:** **Toggle Mode**
- Hands-free for long sessions
- Can use both hands for documents
- Deliberate start/stop points

```python
config.PTT_MODE = "toggle"
config.PTT_TIMEOUT = 300.0  # 5 minutes max
config.PTT_KEY_COMBO = "F9"
```

---

### Scenario 3: AI Coding Assistant (Bumba Voice)

**Need:** Variable-length questions and commands

**Recommendation:** **Hybrid Mode**
- Natural conversation flow
- Auto-stops on pause
- Manual override available
- Best UX for interactive AI

```python
config.PTT_MODE = "hybrid"
config.SILENCE_THRESHOLD_MS = 1500
config.PTT_MIN_DURATION = 0.5
config.PTT_KEY_COMBO = "option_r"
```

---

### Scenario 4: Accessibility Use Case

**Need:** User with limited fine motor control

**Recommendation:** **Toggle Mode**
- Single press to start/stop
- No need to hold key
- Can use adaptive switches
- No fatigue

```python
config.PTT_MODE = "toggle"
config.PTT_KEY_COMBO = "F12"  # Large key
config.PTT_TIMEOUT = 180.0     # Generous timeout
```

---

### Scenario 5: Noisy Office Environment

**Need:** Accurate recordings despite background noise

**Recommendation:** **Hold Mode**
- Manual control prevents false triggers
- Background noise won't auto-stop recording
- Clear start/end points

```python
config.PTT_MODE = "hold"
config.PTT_MIN_DURATION = 0.7  # Higher to prevent noise triggering
config.PTT_KEY_COMBO = "ctrl+space"
# Disable silence detection (not applicable in Hold mode anyway)
```

## Performance Comparison

| Metric | Hold | Toggle | Hybrid |
|--------|------|--------|--------|
| CPU Usage (idle) | <1% | <1% | <1% |
| CPU Usage (recording) | 2-4% | 2-4% | 4-6%* |
| Memory Usage | 50MB | 50MB | 55MB* |
| Latency (start) | <50ms | <50ms | <50ms |
| Latency (stop) | <100ms | <100ms | 100-200ms* |
| Battery Impact | Low | Low | Medium* |

*Higher due to silence detection processing

## Troubleshooting by Mode

### Hold Mode Issues

**Problem:** Accidentally stops too early
- **Solution:** Increase `PTT_MIN_DURATION` to 0.7-1.0 seconds

**Problem:** Tiring to hold key
- **Solution:** Switch to Hybrid or Toggle mode

---

### Toggle Mode Issues

**Problem:** Forget to stop recording
- **Solution:** Lower `PTT_TIMEOUT` for safety

**Problem:** Accidental double-tap stops immediately
- **Solution:** Use dedicated function key (F9-F12)

---

### Hybrid Mode Issues

**Problem:** Stops on natural speech pauses
- **Solution:** Increase `SILENCE_THRESHOLD_MS` to 2000-3000ms

**Problem:** Takes too long to auto-stop
- **Solution:** Decrease `SILENCE_THRESHOLD_MS` or release key manually

**Problem:** Doesn't auto-stop at all
- **Solution:** Check silence detection is configured, verify microphone works

---

## Summary Recommendations

**Choose Hold Mode if:**
- You need precise, manual control
- You're familiar with classic PTT
- Quick commands are your primary use case
- You work in a noisy environment

**Choose Toggle Mode if:**
- You need hands-free operation
- You do long-form dictation
- You have accessibility requirements
- You're multi-tasking while speaking

**Choose Hybrid Mode if:**
- You want the best of both worlds
- You have variable-length inputs
- You're using an AI assistant
- You want smart auto-stop behavior

**Still unsure?**
Start with **Hybrid Mode** - it provides manual control like Hold but auto-stops when you're done speaking. It's the most versatile option for interactive voice applications.
